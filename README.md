# Palmpay-Business-Intelligence-Analysis-Sales-Performance-Market-Insights
Team-based Business Intelligence project analyzing Palmpay sales data. We applied analytical thinking to uncover trends, anomalies, and seasonality patterns—linking insights to real business events like the 2008 crisis and driving data-informed recommendations.
## Project Overview  

The dataset contained thousands of transaction records across multiple countries and product categories. Our goal was to move beyond surface-level summaries and uncover **underlying business behaviors, market trends, and anomalies** that drive decision-making.  

We analyzed sales performance across years, investigated anomalies like the **Lehman crisis impact (2008)**, explored **seasonality trends**, and identified both **top-performing** and **underperforming products**.  

## Problem-Solving Approach  

1. **Data Familiarization:**  
   - Explored data structure, transaction currencies, and completeness.  
   - Validated fields for accurate country, product, and time-based comparisons.  

2. **Behavior Analysis (SECTION A):**  
   - Compared **sales trends between countries** over multiple years.  
   - Identified patterns in sales fluctuations and potential causes from the dataset.  
   - Excluded key outliers (e.g., *Silicon Valley Bikes*) to assess true market behavior and **linked findings to macroeconomic events** like the 2008 financial crisis.  

3. **Product Insights (SECTION B):**  
   - Determined **flop products** (lowest quantity sold per year).  
   - Identified **top-selling product categories** by total revenue.  
   - Calculated **category contribution percentages** to overall sales.  
   - Highlighted **cities outperforming the average** through conditional formatting.  

4. **Seasonality & Consumer Behavior:**  
   - Tested the assumption that bicycle and accessory sales peak in spring/summer.  
   - Identified products showing **a lack of expected seasonality** and explained possible reasons.  

5. **Strategic Insights & Recommendations:**  
   - Connected analytical results to **business implications**, such as pricing strategy, demand planning, and inventory optimization.  
   - Suggested **data-driven improvements** for understanding customer behavior and optimizing sales cycles.   

## Learnings  

This project deepened our understanding of how **data context matters more than visuals**.  
We learned to:  
- Investigate *why* trends occur, not just *what* trends exist.  
- Connect data stories to real-world events and economic behavior.  
- Present analytical reasoning in a way that supports **strategic decision-making**.  

## Tools Used  
- Microsoft Excel (data cleaning)
- Power Bi (Dax formulas, Data visualization)
- PowerPoint (report presentation and insight storytelling)

## 🤝 Teamwork  
This project was completed collaboratively as a **team**, where each member contributed to different stages — from data preparation and analysis to insight synthesis and presentation.


### Summary  

This wasn’t just about creating dashboards, it was about thinking like an analyst:  
identifying trends, challenging assumptions, and turning messy data into business strategy.
